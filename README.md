If you want to test anything in prod mode locally

```bash

## Writing Posts with MDX

Create a markdown file in `/pages/blog/<filename>.mdx`.

It will be picked up by the blog infra.

- It can be accessed through the url path `/blog/<filename>`
- It will be listed on the blog feed page `/blog` when the status is 'published'.
  - Note: if the new content doesn't show up in the feed, you may need to run `yarn refresh && yarn build` and regenerate the metadata cache ([related issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-enhanced/issues/17))

### Metadata in Frontmatter

We support frontmatter in markdown so you can specify meta information about the post at the beginning of the file, such as

```
---
layout: 'BlogPost'
status: 'published'
title: 'Dagster: The Data Orchestrator'
excerpt: 'Dagster is a new type of workflow engine: a data orchestrator. Moving beyond just managing the ordering and physical execution of data computations, Dagster introduces a new primitive: a data-aware, typed, self-describing, logical orchestration graph.
