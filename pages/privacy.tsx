          What is Personal Information?

        <p className="text-blue-900 flex justify-left pb-2">
          When we use the term “Personal Information” in this Privacy Notice, we mean information
          that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or
          could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to an individual. It does not include
          aggregated or deidentified information that is maintained in a form that is not reasonably
          capable of being associated with or linked to an individual.

          Our Collection of Personal Information
        </p>
        <p className="text-blue-900 flex justify-left pb-2">
          Sometimes we collect Personal Information automatically when an individual interacts with
          our Services and sometimes we collect Personal Information directly from an individual. At
          times, we may collect Personal Information about an individual from other sources and
          third parties, even before our first direct interaction. Personal Information Collected
          from Site Visitors We collect the following Personal Information submitted to us by
          visitors to our Site: Contact Information, including name, email address, mailing address,
          company, employer, store address, phone number and communication preferences. Inquiry
          Information, including information provided in custom messages sent through the forms or
          contact information provided on our Site. Personal Information Automatically Collected As
          is true of most digital platforms, we and our third-party providers may also collect
          Personal Information from an individual’s device, browsing actions and site usage patterns
          automatically when visiting or interacting with our Site, which may include log data (such
          as internet protocol (IP) address, operating system, browser type, browser id, the URL
          entered and the referring page/campaign, date/time of visit, the time spent on our Site
          and any errors that may occur during the visit to our Site) and analytics data (such as
          the electronic path taken to our Site, through our Site and when exiting our Site, as well
          as usage and activity on our Site). We and our third-party providers may use (i) cookies
          or small data files that are stored on an individual’s computer and (ii) other, related
          technologies, such as web beacons, pixels, embedded scripts, location-identifying
          technologies and logging technologies (collectively, “cookies”) to automatically collect
          this Personal Information. For example, our Site uses Google Analytics, a web analytics
          service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”), to collect and view reports about the traffic
          on our Site. More information about the use of Google Analytics for these analytical and
          nonadvertising purposes can be obtained by visiting Google’s privacy policy here and
          Google’s currently available opt-out options are available here. To manage cookies, an
          individual may change their browser settings to: (i) notify them when they receive a
          cookie, so the individual can choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) disable existing
          cookies; or (iii) automatically reject cookies. Please note that doing so may negatively
          impact an individual’s experience using our Site, as some features and offerings may not
          work properly or at all. Depending on an individual’s device and operating system, the
          individual may not be able to delete or block all cookies. In addition, if an individual
          wants to reject cookies across all browsers and devices, the individual will need to do so
          on each browser on each device they actively use. An individual may also set their email
          options to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may contain technologies that
          would allow us to know whether they have accessed our email and performed certain
          functions with it. Personal Information from Third Parties We also obtain Personal
          Information from third parties; which we often combine with Personal Information we
          collect either automatically or directly from an individual. We may receive the same
          categories of Personal Information as described above from the following third parties:
          Your Employer / Company: If you engage in our Services through your employer or company,
          we may receive information from the company such as name and contact information. Social
          Media: When an individual interacts with our Services through various social media
          networks, such as when someone logs in through a social network, “Likes” us on Facebook or
          follows us or shares our content on Google, Facebook, Twitter, or other social networks,
          we may receive some information about individuals that they permit the social network to
          share with third parties. The data we receive is dependent upon an individual’s privacy
          settings with the social network. Individuals should always review and, if necessary,
          adjust their privacy settings on third-party websites and social media networks and
          services before sharing information and/or linking or connecting them to other services.
          Service Providers: Our service providers that perform services solely on our behalf, such
          as survey and marketing providers, collect Personal Information and often share some or
          all of this information with us. Information Providers: We may from time to time obtain
          information from third-party information providers to correct or supplement Personal
          Information we collect. For example, we may obtain updated contact information from
          third-party information providers to reconnect with an individual. Publicly Available
          Sources: We collect Personal Information about individuals that we do not otherwise have,
          such as contact information, employment-related information, and interest-in-services
          information, from publicly available sources. We may combine this information with the
          information we collect from an individual directly. We use this information to contact
          individuals, to send advertising or promotional materials or to personalize our Services
          and to better understand the demographics of the individuals with whom we interact.

          scope of the inquiry/request and/or Personal Information we require fall outside the scope
          of this Privacy Notice. In that case, the additional privacy disclosures will govern how
          we may process the information provided at that time.
