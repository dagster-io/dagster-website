          Personal Information from an individual’s device, browsing actions and site usage patterns
          automatically when visiting or interacting with our Site, which may include log data (such
          as internet protocol (IP) address, operating system, browser type, browser id, the URL
          entered and the referring page/campaign, date/time of visit, the time spent on our Site
          and any errors that may occur during the visit to our Site) and analytics data (such as
          the electronic path taken to our Site, through our Site and when exiting our Site, as well
          as usage and activity on our Site). We and our third-party providers may use (i) cookies

          technologies and logging technologies (collectively, “
          <strong className="font-semibold">cookies</strong>”) to automatically collect this
          Personal Information. For example, our Site uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service

          and view reports about the traffic on our Site. More information about the use of Google

          disable existing cookies; or (iii) automatically reject cookies. Please note that doing so

          addition, if an individual wants to reject cookies across all browsers and devices, the
          individual will need to do so on each browser on each device they actively use. An
          individual may also set their email options to prevent the automatic downloading of images

          email and performed certain functions with it.

          <u>Personal Information from Third Parties</u>
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          We also obtain Personal Information from third parties; which we often combine with
          Personal Information we collect either automatically or directly from an individual.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          We may receive the same categories of Personal Information as described above from the
          following third parties:

          <li>
            <strong className="font-semibold">Social Media</strong>: When an individual interacts

            through a social network, “Likes” us on Facebook or follows us or shares our content on
            Google, Facebook, Twitter, or other social networks, we may receive some information
            about individuals that they permit the social network to share with third parties. The
            data we receive is dependent upon an individual’s privacy settings with the social
            network. Individuals should always review and, if necessary, adjust their privacy
            settings on third-party websites and social media networks and services before sharing
            information and/or linking or connecting them to other services.
